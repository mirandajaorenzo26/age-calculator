# Age Calculator App
This is a simple age calculator app built using React and Vite. The app allows users to enter their birthdate and calculates their age in years, months, and days. This is a challenge by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).

## Getting Started
To get started with this app, simply clone the repository to your local machine and install the dependencies using npm:

> git clone [https://github.com/mirandajaorenzo26/age-calculator.git](https://github.com/mirandajaorenzo26/age-calculator.git)

> cd age-calculator

> npm install

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server using the following command:


> npm run dev

This will start the development server and open the app in your default browser. Any changes you make to the code will be automatically reloaded in the browser.

## Usage
To use the app, simply enter your birthdate in the format YYYY-MM-DD and click the circle purple button. The app will then calculate your age in years, months, and days and display the result on the page.

## Building for Production
To build the app for production, run the following command:

>npm run build

This will create a production-ready build of the app in the dist directory.
